## 📏 Architecture Principles

### Code Quality Standards

**Module Size Guidelines:**
- **Target:** <400 lines per module (Ideal)
- **Acceptable:** 400-600 lines (OK, monitor growth)
- **Absolute Limit:** 600-800 lines (Warning - at the limit)
- **Priority Refactor:** >800 lines (MUST refactor)

**Complexity Targets:**
- Cyclomatic complexity: <10 per function
- Function length: <50 lines
- Class methods: <15 per class
- Nesting depth: <4 levels

### Design Principles
1. **Separation of Concerns** - Clear boundaries between layers
2. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** - Shared code in libraries
3. **SOLID Principles** - Especially Single Responsibility
4. **Fail Fast** - Early validation and clear error messages
5. **Security by Default** - Secure configurations out of the box

## 🏗️ Technical Stack

### Languages
- **Python 3.13+** (Primary)
- **Shell/Bash** (Automation)
- **JavaScript/TypeScript** (Web components)

### Tools & Infrastructure
- **UV** - Fast Python package manager (10-100x faster)
- **Git** - Version control (GitHub: SilverWizardAI organization)
- **Flet** - Cross-platform UI framework
- **PyQt** - Alternative UI framework
- **pytest** - Testing framework
- **Docker** - Containerization (where applicable)

---

## 🔒 Autonomy & Permissions

### Full Autonomy Within EE Folder
You have **complete autonomy** to:
- Create, modify, delete files in `/A_Coding/EE/**`
- Commit, push, create branches in EE git repository
- Run any bash commands within EE folder
- Install dependencies and tools for EE project
- Make architectural decisions for EE infrastructure

### Read-Only Access to Sister Projects
You can **read** from all sister projects to:
- Understand patterns and implementations
- Learn from existing code
- Identify opportunities for shared infrastructure
- Analyze dependencies and integration points

**You MUST ask permission before:**
- Modifying any files outside `/A_Coding/EE/**`
- Making changes to sister projects
- Running destructive commands outside EE folder

## 🎓 Best Practices

### When Creating Infrastructure Components

1. **Think Cross-Project**
   - Will this be useful in multiple Silver Wizard products?
   - Can this be generalized for broader use?
   - What's the right abstraction level?

2. **Document Thoroughly**
   - Clear README.md for each component
   - API documentation with examples
   - Architecture decisions and rationale
   - Migration guides for breaking changes

3. **Test Comprehensively**
   - Unit tests for all components
   - Integration tests for cross-component interactions
   - Performance benchmarks where relevant
   - Security testing for infrastructure code

4. **Version Carefully**
   - Semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
   - Changelog for all releases
   - Deprecation warnings before breaking changes
   - Clear upgrade paths
