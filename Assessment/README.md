2. **C3** - Claude Code Coach/Commander (Orchestration hub)
3. **CMC** - Creative Mentor Companion (C3 fork for manuscripts)
4. **EE** - Enterprise Edition (Infrastructure & tools)
5. **FS** - Forbidden Spice (Manuscript project)
6. **MacR** - Mac Retriever (Flet version - stable)
7. **MacR-PyQt** - Mac Retriever (PyQt6 migration)
8. **MM** - MCP Mesh (Service mesh for inter-instance comms)
9. **NG** - Network Guardian (Privacy-first network monitoring)
10. **PIW** - Package & Install Wizard (Python app bundling)
11. **PQTI** - PyQt Instrument (GUI instrumentation library)

## Assessment Documents

### Primary Documents

- **[CATALOG.md](./CATALOG.md)** - Complete ecosystem overview with integration map
- **[PLANNING.md](./PLANNING.md)** - Strategic bootstrapping roadmap for full automation

### Individual Capability Assessments

Each app has a detailed capability file covering:
- Current features & capabilities
- Future roadmap items
- Integration points with other apps
- Automation potential
- Claude Code instrumentation quality
- Strategic value in the SW factory vision

**Capability Files:**
- [Brand_Manager-capabilities.md](./Brand_Manager-capabilities.md)
- [C3-capabilities.md](./C3-capabilities.md)
- [CMC-capabilities.md](./CMC-capabilities.md)
- [EE-capabilities.md](./EE-capabilities.md)
- [FS-capabilities.md](./FS-capabilities.md)
- [MacR-capabilities.md](./MacR-capabilities.md)
- [MacR-PyQt-capabilities.md](./MacR-PyQt-capabilities.md)
- [MM-capabilities.md](./MM-capabilities.md)
- [NG-capabilities.md](./NG-capabilities.md)
- [PIW-capabilities.md](./PIW-capabilities.md)
- [PQTI-capabilities.md](./PQTI-capabilities.md)

## Key Findings Summary

### Claude Code Instrumentation Status

**✅ Good CC Setup (4 apps):**
- C3 - Basic structure guide
- FS - Router/index to detailed docs
- MacR - Campaign artifacts (temporary)
- MacR-PyQt - Campaign artifacts (temporary)

**⚠️ Needs Standardization (7 apps):**
- Brand_Manager, CMC, MM, NG, PIW, PQTI, EE - Missing comprehensive CLAUDE.md

### Strategic Insights

1. **C3 is the orchestration hub** - Already has 10 major capability areas
2. **MM (MCP Mesh) is the game-changer** - Enables real-time inter-instance communication
3. **Significant automation potential** - File polling → real-time mesh, hardcoded rules → AI decisions
4. **Need for standardization** - CC instrumentation varies widely across apps
