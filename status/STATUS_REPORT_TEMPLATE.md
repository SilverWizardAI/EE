# Status Report Template

## FOR STARTUP: Keep It Brief!

**What the user wants on restart:**

```
# EE Status

**Current State:** [Production Ready / In Progress / Blocked]
**Token Budget:** [X]K / 200K ([X]%)
**Git:** [Clean / N files modified]

## Last Session
- [Key achievement 1]
- [Key achievement 2]
- [Any issues to verify]

## Ready For
[What should I do next / waiting for instructions]
```

**Maximum length:** ~10-15 lines

## Example (GOOD):

```
# EE Status

**Current State:** Production Ready ✅
**Token Budget:** 38K / 200K (19%)
**Git:** Clean

## Last Session (Feb 7)
- ✅ Token management system (35% threshold)
- ✅ CCM UI improvements (tabbed, 70% screen)
- ⚠️ Minor: Verify icon/title (8 commits for simple fixes)

## Ready For
Next instructions or verify CCM UI?
```

## Example (BAD - TOO LONG):

[The report I just gave - 200+ lines with sections, subsections, insights, etc.]
